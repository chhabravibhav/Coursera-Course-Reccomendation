## Coursera Course Recommendation System

This repository explores the development of a recommendation system for Coursera courses, aiming to personalize the learning experience for users.

###  Goal

The project seeks to create a system that recommends courses tailored to individual user interests, skill levels, and career goals.

###  Problem Statement

The challenge lies in developing a system that accurately suggests Coursera courses to users based on:

* Past learning behaviors
* Preferences
* Professional goals

###  Approach

The approach incorporates several key steps to ensure effective personalization and accurate course suggestions:

**1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**

* Load a comprehensive dataset containing user profiles and course catalogs. 
* User data includes demographics, course enrollments, completion rates, and feedback.
* Course data includes subject, difficulty level, and learning outcomes.
* Clean and preprocess the data for consistency and relevance.
    * Handle missing values.
    * Normalize data formats.
    * Encode categorical data.
    * Refine user data by filtering anomalies or outliers.

**2. Feature Engineering**

* Extract and construct relevant features that influence course recommendations.
    * Derive new variables such as user learning patterns, course popularity scores, and previous course ratings.
* Perform dimensionality reduction techniques if needed to enhance model performance and reduce overfitting.

**3. User Profiling and Course Vectorization**

* Develop comprehensive user profiles based on activity, preferences, and feedback.
* Utilize techniques like TF-IDF or Word2Vec to vectorize course descriptions, learning objectives, and user reviews, creating a numerical representation of textual data.

**4. Collaborative Filtering**

* Implement collaborative filtering algorithms to identify courses similar users have enjoyed, recommending them to others with similar profiles.
* Explore both user-based and item-based techniques to enhance recommendation diversity and accuracy.

**5. Model Training and Optimization**

* Train various machine learning models to predict user-course affinity, including:
    * Matrix factorization models
    * Clustering algorithms
    * Deep learning models like neural networks
* Use grid search and cross-validation to fine-tune model parameters for optimal performance.

**6. Model Evaluation**

* Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve to assess recommendation quality.
* Implement A/B testing by deploying different models to user segments and evaluating real-world performance.

**7. System Integration and Real-Time Recommendations**

* Integrate the recommendation system with the Coursera platform for real-time course suggestions based on user interactions and feedback.
* Implement feedback loops where the system learns from user enrollment actions post-recommendation.

**8. Model Saving and Updating**

* Save the trained models and periodically retrain them with new user data and course offerings to keep recommendations relevant and up-to-date.
* Regularly report key metrics such as user satisfaction and increased enrollment rates to stakeholders.

**Text Preprocessing Techniques:**

* Stop Word Removal: Remove common words (e.g., "the," "and," "a") using NLTK library's stopwords corpus.
* Punctuation Removal: Remove punctuation marks using a custom function.
* Stemming: Reduce words to their root form using the PorterStemmer from NLTK.

**Feature Engineering Techniques:**

* CountVectorizer: Converts text into a matrix of token counts, representing word frequency within the corpus.
* TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Calculates a word's importance to a document within a collection.

**Recommendation Systems:**

* Cosine Similarity: Calculates a similarity score between documents (courses) based on how similar their term vectors are in terms of angle.
* Matrix Factorization (Truncated SVD): Decomposes the user-item rating matrix into lower-dimensional factors representing user preferences and course characteristics. Recommendations are made by predicting ratings for unseen course-user combinations.

This structured approach ensures a robust, scalable recommendation system that continuously improves with more data, enhancing user experience and educational outcomes.
